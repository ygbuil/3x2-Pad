![3x2_pad](imgur.com image replace me!)

*A short description of the keyboard/project*

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Lloren√ß Buil](https://github.com/ygbuil)
* Hardware Supported: *The PCBs, controllers supported*
* Hardware Availability: *Links to where you can find this hardware*

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make 3x2_pad:default

Flashing example for this keyboard:

    make 3x2_pad:default:flash

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available

## Create firmware

* Install QMK according to docs.
* Open folder `<local_path>/qmk_firmware` in VSCode.
* Run `qmk new-keyboard`.
    * Choose keyboard name: `3x2_pad` (no spaces and all lower case, this will actually be the keyboard folder name).
    * Choose layout: `None of the above`.
    * Choose MCU: Choose yours.
* Go to `/qmk_firmware/keyboards/3x2_pad/keyboard.json` and:
    * Modify `cols` and `rows` to map the MCU pins to the rows and cols of our schematic: 
        ```json
        "matrix_pins": {
            "cols": ["B1", "B3"],
            "rows": ["F7", "B2", "B6"]
        }
        ```
        <div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">

            <img src="images/schematic.png" alt="Schematic" width="45%">
        </div>
    * Modify `pid` (product id) and `vid` (vendor id) to yor likings with the help of a "ascii to hex online convertor".
    * Modify `layout` key:
        * `matrix` represents the key location in the schematic matrix, represented as `[<row>, <col>]`.
        * `x` and `y` are the coordinates in key units (1u, 1.25u, etc) of the top left position of a key, with the origin of coordinates situated at the top left.
        * In case a key is different than `1u`, we need to specify its width `w`.
    
        ```json
        "layout": [
            {"matrix": [0, 0], "x": 0, "y": 0},
            {"matrix": [0, 1], "x": 1, "y": 0},
            {"matrix": [1, 0], "x": 0, "y": 1},
            {"matrix": [1, 1], "x": 1, "y": 1},
            {"matrix": [2, 0], "x": 0, "y": 2, "w": 2}
        ]
        ```
* Create `/qmk_firmware/keyboards/3x2_pad/keymaps/default/rules.mk` with the content: `VIA_ENABLE = yes`.
* Modify `/qmk_firmware/keyboards/3x2_pad/keymaps/default/keymap.c` `LAYOUT` to the desired default layout:
    ```json
    LAYOUT(
        KC_P3,   KC_P4,
        KC_P1,   KC_P2,
        KC_P0
    )
    ```
* In `/qmk_firmware/keyboards/3x2_pad/`, create a `via.json` from scratch as you can see in this repo. The `keymap` key is derived from inputing in the Keyboard Layout Editor the `[<row>, <col>]` (explained before) and extracting the raw data.

* Flash the keyboard with `qmk flash -kb 3x2_pad -km default`. First it will compile a `3x2_pad_default.hex` file in `/qmk_firmware`. Then it will prompt you to enter bootloader mode by closing the circuit for RESET and GND. Once you do it, flashing will start and after that keyboard will be ready to use.
* To use it with Via, go to design tab and upload `/qmk_firmware/keyboards/3x2_pad/via.json`.
